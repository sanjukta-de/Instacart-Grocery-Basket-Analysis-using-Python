## Objective & Key Questions:
Perform an exploratory analysis of the company's sales patterns to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation by addressing the following key questions:
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know wether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use similar price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales team want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
